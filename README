/// .docgen ///

A simple, extensible, documentation generation utility.  Scrapes documentation from source code comments using a specific syntax.  Supports pluggable output formats, for example to render to Markdown or HTML.

.docgen will attempt to guess the comment prefix it should use from the file extension.  If its guess is incorrect, or if it cannot guess, you may specify the prefix to use with the "--language" option

Examples:
  
To scrape documentation from example.lua into docs.md:

  dotdocgen --format md example.lua docs.md

To scrape documentation from several files into docs.html:
  
  dotdocgen --format html $(find example/ -type f) docs.md
