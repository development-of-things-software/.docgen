/// .docgen ///

A simple, extensible, documentation generation utility.  Scrapes documentation from source code comments using a specific syntax.  Supports pluggable output formats, for example to render to Markdown or HTML.

Examples:
  
To scrape documentation from example.lua into docs.md:

  dotdocgen --format md example.lua docs.md

To scrape documentation from several files into docs.html:
  
  dotdocgen --format html $(find example/ -type f) docs.md

.docgen will try to guess the comment prefix it should use from the file extension, but sometimes this will not work.  You can manually pass the --comment option to tell .docgen where to look for comments.
